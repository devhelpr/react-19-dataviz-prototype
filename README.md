# Data Visualization react/d3 PoC

This repo is created with Cursor.com. My goals was to experiment with Cursor and build a simple react/d3 app with some features for viewing and analyzing data with multiple visualizations on different pages.
I've tried to use cursor as much as possible to generate the code and NOT manually adjust the code. This would not be the way I would build a production app, but it was a fun experiment.

I've wrote a small article about it, you can find it here: [Experiment with Cursor](https://www.devhelpr.com/articles/experimenting-with-cursor/)

## How to run
